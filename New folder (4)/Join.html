        Joining control's Fortnite roster is more of a privilege than an
        opportunity. Here at Control's Fortnite roster we try to look for
        something unique and of course something we haven't seen before in a
        player. In order to join you must do the following: First post montages
        or clips in ︱fn-clips showing off your skills and game sense. We'd like
        the clips be at least 1080p if possible (exceptions can be made). If or
        when you join the team one of the @Owner will dm you telling you that
        you made the team. For grinders however, the reason we give you grinder
        falls under the category of lack of improvement. If we see every clip is
        pretty much the same and there is no uniqueness to the clips then that
        becomes a red flag. We do give you limitless opportunities to join us
        but after the first time of getting shut down and you come back with no
        improvement, we'll tell you that and give you some advice on how to get
        better.

        How to Join as a Rocket League Player As I said before, joining the
        Rocket League is more of a privilege than an opportunity, and the same
        applies for our Rocket League team. In order to join the Rocket League
        roster there is a few things you need to do first: First post clips or
        montages in ︱rl-clips showing off your skills with maneuvering the ball
        and show some highlights of some crazy shots that show uniqueness. Being
        unique is probably our number 1 modo for joining this team, Control
        doesn't want to be some regular ordinary team, we wanna show some
        uniqueness in our players and in our content. When you find out that
        you've met the requirements to join and you've submitted your clips or
        montages to the submissions, a grinder role might appear under your name
        which is a good thing. We think you have potential to get better and we
        think that sometime in the future, you'd be a great addition to the
        team.

        How to join as a GFX Designer (Graphics Designer) As you may have read
        before, being unique is one of our main goals at Control. In the GFX
        side of things, we look for creativity more than the quality of your
        work. Of course we want some decency when it comes to the quality of
        graphics but care more about the creativity over everything. In order to
        join as a GFX Designer, first you must upload some past work that you've
        had in ︱gfx-submissions . I'm not saying this to be rude, but if you
        aren't confident in your work and you doubt yourself in your ability to
        do something, that shows us that you can take on the job. Some past work
        could include some banners you've made for other people or some
        thumbnails. . How to join as a VFX Editor (Video Editor) Joining VFX is
        something that is very crucial when it comes to Esports team, if you
        think you have what it takes and you meet all the requirements to join
        VFX, trust me I will make your experience more fun. In order to join as
        VFX, we want the videos be at 1080p in quality, mostly because we want
        to know if you can produce good quality clips for us, and so then we can
        have good quality videos for the COntrol community to see. To post your
        videos, head over to ︱vfx-submissions and submit them there. If you
        receive grinder role then that means we think in the future you would be
        a nice addition to the VFX team. On the other hand, if you end up
        getting added to the VFX team, you will be officially in the team and as
        time goes by listen to staff members or head of VFX for your tasks.
